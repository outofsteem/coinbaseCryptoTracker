###  [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) Crypto Tracker
- Ever wished there was an easy way to track your [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) crypto investments? I wish I had one! Then I realized, why not just build one :)
- Introducing [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) Crypto Tracker (CCT)! CCT makes it easy to track your [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) investments. Just enter the transaction details on the Investment Transactions worksheet including: Coin, Date, Amount Invested, Purchase Price, and Purchase Amount. The Effective price is a calculation that will  tell you what price you paid per transaction after factoring in the [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) fees.

### The Dashboard
- CCT includes a basic dashboard to show your return on investment (ROI) on a coin by coin basis. It tallies up the total amount owned per coin as well as  your profit and gains/losses
- No surprises! Ever try to buy or sell a coin on [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) only to find that the price is different than what is displayed? This is because [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) has 3 different prices, a buy price, a sell price, and a spot price. The buy price will be the price you pay if you were to buy a coin. This price will be higher than what you initially see in [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38). The sell price is the price you get if you were to sell your coin. This will be a lower number than what you see in [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38). The spot price is the price that [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) shows you. It is a simple average of the buy and sell prices. The CCT pulls the Buy, Sell, and Spot prices from the [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a260f48c2c93f02a4c6bd38) API to give you accurate pricing data. With just a click, you can get the most current data. When calculating your profit, the CCT uses the sell price to calculate your profit, to reflect the most accurate gain/loss for you possible.
- Included in the dashboard are two graphs to show you your profit/loss on a coin-by-coin basis as well as a pie chart to show your investment breakdown in each coin.
